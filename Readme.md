This is forked from version 1.0.9 of Alphablackwolf's repository. Originally started to add "painless prestige" mode, before author added his own implementation of the same later (along with host of other architectural changes).

Since
- upstream has been dead for some time
- their sources don't build out of the box (hard reference on Luck skill)
- are not updated for SDV 1.3

I've decided to keep this version for now and use it to follow SDV releases. Until I find enough time to properly fix upstream sources for SDV 1.3. Or Alphablackwolf comes alive again.
